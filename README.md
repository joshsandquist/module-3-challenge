Module 3 Code Refactor Challenge - Password generator


## Installation

None

## Usage

This project used JavaScript and DOM manipulation to generate a password based on user criteria. I went through many iterations in order to make sure all the bugs were worked out and that the password could be reset without adding on to previous passwords, or using previous user choices.
